# Accessible LLM Response System

This system is designed to improve the accessibility and navigability of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for blind and visually impaired users. It consists of four core modules:

---

## 1. LLM Response Structuring Engine (LRSE)
- Applies **natural language processing** techniques to segment and semantically tag LLM-generated content.
- Breaks content into **navigable sections** such as:
  - Headings  
  - Summaries  
  - Examples  
  - Lists  

---

## 2. Accessibility Formatter Module (AFM)
- Embeds **accessibility metadata** into structured content.  
- Ensures compliance with:
  - **ARIA** (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)  
  - **WCAG 2.1** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)  
- Guarantees compatibility with **screen readers** and other assistive tools.

---

## 3. User Configuration Layer (UCL)
- Provides an **interface for end-users** to customize presentation.  
- Configurable parameters include:
  - **Verbosity level**  
  - **Content granularity**  
  - **Preferred linguistic style** (e.g., formal vs. simplified)  
- Supports **personalization** and **cognitive load management**.

---

## 4. Multimodal Output Renderer (MOR)
- Delivers content through **multiple accessible modalities**, including:
  - Synthesized speech  
  - Braille output (via refreshable displays)  
  - Haptic cues  
- Aims to create a **flexible and inclusive user experience**.

---

## Goal
To enable **blind and visually impaired users** to efficiently consume and navigate LLM-generated content through structured, accessible, and multimodal outputs.
